Finite element .msh format loader and parser â€“ unit tested and written in TypeScript.

Live demo: [apps.amandaghassaei.com/msh-parser/demo/](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/msh-parser/demo/)


## .msh File Format

The MSH file format is used for storing 3D finite element mesh information for simulation purposes.  This library does not generate or render .msh files, but it will allow you to parse them in a browser or Nodejs environment.  You can generate tetrahedral .msh files from boundary meshes (.stl, .obj) using [TetWild](https://wildmeshing.github.io/tetwild/).  You can view .msh files with [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) or by dragging them into the [demo app](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/msh-parser/demo/).  Example .msh files can be found in [test/msh/](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/msh-parser/tree/main/test/msh).


## Installation

### Install via npm

```sh
npm install msh-parser
```

and import into your project:

```js
import { parseMSH, loadMSH, loadMSHAsync } from 'msh-parser';
```

### Import into HTML

Import [bundle/msh-parser.min.js](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/msh-parser/blob/main/dist/msh-parser.min.js) directly into your html:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="msh-parser.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

`MSHParserLib` will be accessible globally:

```js
const { parseMSH, loadMSH, loadMSHAsync } = MSHParserLib;
```


## Use

Full API documentation in [docs](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/msh-parser/blob/main/docs/).

```js
// Load and parse the .msh file using the specified file path.
loadMSH('./bunny.msh', (mesh) => {
  const {
    nodes,
    elementIndices,
    edgeIndices,
    exteriorEdgeIndices,
    exteriorFaceIndices,
    elementVolumes,
    nodalVolumes,
    isTetMesh,
    numExteriorNodes,
    boundingBox,
  } = mesh;
});
// Also try:
// const mesh = loadMSHAsync('./bunny.msh');

// Or parse synchronously from file buffer.
const mesh = parseMSH(fs.readFileSync('./bunny.msh'));
```

- `nodes` is a Float32Array or Float64Array of length 3 * numNodes containing a flat list of node positions in the following order `[x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, ...]`.
- `elementIndices` is a 2 dimensional array of node indices corresponding to the finite elements of the mesh.  For a tetrahedral mesh, all elements will contain four node indices, but element length may vary for other types of meshes.  `elementIndices` has the following structure:
```js
[
  [e0a, e0b, e0c, e0d], // Element 0
  [e1a, e1b, e1c, e1d], // Element 1
  ...
]
```
- `edgeIndices` (tet-meshes only for now) is a Uint32Array containing all pairs of edgeIndices in the mesh.  Node indices are in the form: `[e01, e02, e11, e12, ...]`.  `edgeIndices` is calculated when queried and then cached.
- `exteriorEdgeIndices` (tet-meshes only for now) is a Uint32Array containing all pairs of exterior edgeIndices in the mesh.  Node indices are in the form: `[e01, e02, e11, e12, ...]`.  `exteriorEdgeIndices` is calculated when queried and then cached.
- `exteriorFaceIndices` (tet-meshes only for now) is a 2 dimensional array of node indices corresponding to the exterior faces of the mesh.  For a tetrahedral mesh, all exterior faces will be triangles, but face shape may vary for other types of meshes.  Triangular exterior faces have CC winding order.  `exteriorFacesArray` has the following structure:
```js
[
  [f0a, f0b, f0c], // Face 0
  [f1a, f1b, f1c], // Face 1
  ...
]
```
- `elementVolumes` (tet-meshes only for now) is a Float32Array containing the volume of all elements in the mesh.  `elementVolumes` is calculated when queried and then cached.
- `nodalVolumes` (tet-meshes only for now) is a Float32Array containing the approximate volume of all nodes in the mesh.  This is calculated by evenly distributing element volume across adjacent nodes.  `nodalVolumes` is calculated when queried and then cached.
- `isTetMesh` is a boolean that indicates all mesh elements are tetrahedra.
- `numExteriorNodes` (tet-meshes only for now) is the number of nodes that lie on the exterior of the mesh.  `nodes` has been ordered so that the nodes in the range [0, numExteriorNodes - 1] correspond to the nodes referenced by `exteriorFaceIndices`.
- `boundingBox` is the min and max of the mesh's bounding box in the form: `{ min: [x, y, z], max: [x, y, z] }`.  `boundingBox` is calculated when queried and then cached.


The mesh object returned by `parseMSH`, `loadMSH`, and `loadMSHAsync` also exposes methods for modifying its geometry:

```js
mesh.scaleNodesToUnitBoundingBox();
```

- `MSHMesh.scaleNodesToUnitBoundingBox()` scales the `nodes` values (in place) to fit inside a unit box and centered around the origin.


## Limitations

- This package has only been tested on binary tetrahedral meshes generated by [TetWild](https://wildmeshing.github.io/tetwild/) with double precision.  If you are having trouble parsing a .msh with this library, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/msh-parser/issues) and attach a sample file for testing or submit a pull request with a fix.
- This package does not currently parse field data or tags, though it could be added by implementing more of the following class: [https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh/blob/main/src/IO/MshLoader.cpp](https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh/blob/main/src/IO/MshLoader.cpp).  Pull requests welcome.
